			 * Simple compression algorithm 
			 * @version 2.0.1
			 *
			 * this script loops through text looking for duplicate content
			 * The program notes the position of the start of the duplicate
			 * the program can then build a dictionary based on these positions
			 * finally it removes the duplaicates from the raw data
			 *
			 * in theory when the program is reversed it will loop the positions
			 * adding the data back to the text
			 *
			 * In theory the dictionary combined with the compressed raw data should be smaller than the original
			 *
			 * @todo - currently the dictionary is just not compressing enough
			 * 	   but it's getting closer
