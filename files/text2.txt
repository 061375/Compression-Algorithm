This is a test. This text should compress however, it's very hard to know for sure. If I type enough then I might get a decent compression out of it. But, hey I might not. My dog has a terrible case of fleas. His name is spot. My cat has no fleas because he is cool. Well that is not why he doesn't have fleas but, just maybe. He is a clean cat. His name is Queeker. he is a grey cat. A bengal I think but I am not sure if that is what he is. Man am I hungry. I cannot wait until lunch so I can eat. I want to eat a sandwich or maybe a hamburger with french fries. Maybe not french fries ... Yes I want french fries with that. I know for sure this is going to fail in the first test but the trick will be to determine if the failure happened durring compression or decompression. Hmm, will the algorithm pick up compression as a sub-set of decompression or as two seperate words. Well, I think this is enough text for now to make a viable test.
